*              -- Simple Weather Program by Misha Ward --               *
*       Program asks for user for city name, then provides a 5 day      *
*       forecast for that city. It also provides windspeed for that     *
*       day. The program handles incorrect inputs by providing          *
*       the user error message and promoting them to provide a new      *
*       input or to exit the program.                                   *
*                                                                       *
